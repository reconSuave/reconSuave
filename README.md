Currently working on my doctoral thesis: *"Novel methodologies for Roblox token extraction using sequential copy-paste operators: toward a robust model of skidding in nth-order, time-complex, non-binomial regression matrices of manifold surface type  
2modR + R'."* 

NOTE: this is NOT the sparse field approach as conceived by Yogesh, et al., and R is NOT a Yogesh-Beasley matrix! Its modularity is order 2 which is both prime and even, which is not a sparse field, it is not even chiral! 

***No more emails about this, please.*** 
 

 I’m also interested in ...
